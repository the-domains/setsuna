The Japanese word 'Setsuna' translates to 'moment' or 'instant'. Setsuna was formed by Erik Heirman to combine electronica with recordings of musicians he had met in Hamburg's vibrant music scene. To date Setsuna songs have featured musicians such as: [Marco Winkler][0], [Bassel El Hallack][1], [Thomas Lemmer][2], Gunnar Lippok, [Cristiaan][3][Cassara][3], [Joel][4]

Havea, [Safia Flowers][5], [Dinesh Mishra][6], [Gros Ngolle Pokossi][7], Eva Böbel, [Earthling][8] and [Nordlight][9]. Setsuna's sound can be described as somewhere between between electronica, ambient, downtempo and lounge music. 

After various compilation releases, Setsuna's first album "Spontaneous" was released on SINE Music. Tracks from the album can be found on scene leading compilations such as Erotic Lounge, Bar Lounge Classics, Calm Ibiza, La Nuit, Le Café Abstrait, and Calm Ibiza. Setsuna's music has also been featured on broadcasts by the BBC, [Ibiza Sonica][10], [Nartaks's][11][Nightflight on Klassik FM][12] as well as [The Chill Out Lounge][13] by [Tim Angrave][14].

A one hour Setsuna tracks mix is among the top results for "Lounge" on [YouTube][15] and has been viewed over 4.5 million times
